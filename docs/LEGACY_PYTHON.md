# Legacy Python (Deprecated)

This repository used to ship a Python CLI and MCP server.

As of the Node rewrite:

- End users should install `mailbox` via npm (`mailbox-cli`).
- The supported interface is the `mailbox` CLI JSON contract.
- Python code and Python-focused docs are kept only for historical reference
  during the transition.

If you see references to `uv`, `pytest`, `src/cli.py`, `setup.py`, or `mcp` in
older documents, treat them as legacy.
